        <h2>Project 1 - Composition</h2>
        <p>This project was to practice shooting video. Our four fortunate subjects were the bag, sign, truck, and statue. </p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KZP1fuQxQ_4?si=6kOMq8lx6ncwFpxJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Focusing on camera angles and focal length, I was the sole beholder of the camera as well as picking out the subjects and editing the clips. This project was completed alone.</p>
        <p>This project got me thinking about different ways to present a subject and to become more comftorble getting close to the subject. The best part of this video is the shot of the truck's rusty underbelly. I personally find the darker lighting and rusty texture to be quite appetizing. The main thing that needs changing is the camera's exposure and leveling since many shots are either too bright or too dark. </p>

        <h2>Project 2 - PSA</h2>
        <p>The fiberglass butts people carelessly throw inches from the trashcan don't decompose like paper or grown food. They don't belong anywhere in nature because nobody eats cigarettes. Next time you or someone you know drops a cigarette butt on the ground, think about who it's for.</p>

        <p>In Nobody Eats Cigarettes, I was responsible for the ideas, shooting, eating cigarettes, and editing. My friend, Mason Sorg, played the voice of reason in this PSA.</p>
        <p>This was not my first time making a storyboard and communicating it to a subject, but it was my first time setting up different camera angles to tell a story. I was ill-prepared, doing a lot of standing around and trying to figure out how to execute my idea while my friend waited. I learned it's best to have each shot figured out as well as where we are shooting. The best part of the video is likely when I popped the cigarette in my mouth as that is the climax.  </p>

        <h2>Project 3 - Interview</h2>
        <p>Heather Starr Fiedler is chair of the Department of Community Engagement and Leadership at Point Park University. Heather and her team work to meet students' basic needs like food and clothing so they can thrive as well as connecting students to the outward community of downtown Pittsburgh. If anyone wants to get involved with their community, she urges students to come down to the community engagement center on the second floor of Thayer Hall. </p>

        <p>With the help of Heather Fiedler to provide information about the Department of Community Engagement, I shot and edited alone.</p>
        <p>I learned a lot from this project since I made a lot of mistakes. In addition to getting better at being selective with what to show and telling stories with audio, I learned the importance of having a hard drive. If I could have changed anything, I would have checked the camera out for a full day, so I would have had more time to shoot b-roll and edit. I would say the best part is near the end when Heather speaks passionatly and persuasively about the benefits of being altruistic and helping your community.</p>

        <h2>Project 4 - Freeform</h2>
        <p>
        Take a walk across Smithfield bridge to Emerald View Park. All along are nature's little gifts so tread slowly.</br> 
        The song is named after the beautiful chord that inspired me to write this piece.
        </p>

        <p>This was another solo project. I came up with the idea and shot it on my own, using an old song I recorded in 2020 to accompany a peaceful walk through the woods. </p>
        <p>From this project, I learned what initialize sd card means. I also learned how to record the focus changing and got better at framing and lighting as I wanted my subjects to look their best. The best part is the trough of the song where the changing focus aligns with the bass sliding. Aside from not initializing the card the first run, I would have used more of the loads of footage I took to make the footage play along with the song better.</p>

        <h2>Project 5 - Fiction</h2>
        <p>Fallen on tough times, John meets a strange man who offers him anything his heart desires for something close to him. It's a deal too good too be true.</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dV52Ge4AJdA?si=jrNnuEKVZmKwSe9N" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Mason Sorg played the probably homeless John, and Corey Shaffer played the strange man. I wrote, shot, and edited this piece. </p> 
        <p>I got better at storyboarding and execution albeit there were still many continuity issues. As a result, I learned it's okay to have many different shots of the same thing in addition to the costs of straying from the storyboard. Aside from the constant giggling between shots, the best thing about this project was Corey's eccentric performance. If I had the time and motivation to do it again, I would have put more thought into how I shot it and taken more of a variety of shots to take care of the continuity issue.</p>
