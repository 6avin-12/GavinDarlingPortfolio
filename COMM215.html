        <h2>Project 2 - PSA</h2>
        <p>The fiberglass butts people carelessly throw inches from the trashcan don't decompose like paper or grown food. They don't belong anywhere in nature because nobody eats cigarettes. Next time you or someone you know drops a cigarette butt on the ground, think about who it's for.</p>

        Take a walk across Smithfield bridge to Emerald View Park. All along are nature's little gifts so tread slowly.</br>
